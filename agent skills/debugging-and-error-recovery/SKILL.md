# Debugging and Error Recovery

## Overview

Systematic debugging with structured triage. When something breaks, stop adding features, preserve evidence, and follow a structured process to find and fix the root cause. Guessing wastes time. The triage checklist works for test failures, build errors, runtime bugs, and production incidents.

## When to Use

- Tests fail after a code change
- The build breaks
- Runtime behavior doesn't match expectations
- A bug report arrives
- An error appears in logs or console
- Something worked before and stopped working

## The Stop-the-Line Rule

When anything unexpected happens:

```
1. STOP adding features or making changes
2. PRESERVE evidence (error output, logs, repro steps)
3. DIAGNOSE using the triage checklist
4. FIX the root cause
5. GUARD against recurrence
6. RESUME only after verification passes
```

**Don't push past a failing test or broken build to work on the next feature.** Errors compound. A bug in Step 3 that goes unfixed makes Steps 4-6 wrong.

## The Triage Checklist

Work through these steps in order. Do not skip steps.

### Step 1: Reproduce

Make the failure happen reliably. If you can't reproduce it, you can't fix it with confidence.

- Gather context (logs, environment details).
- Try reproducing in a minimal environment.

### Step 2: Localize

Narrow down WHERE the failure happens:

- UI/Frontend: Check console, DOM, network tab.
- API/Backend: Check server logs, request/response.
- Database: Check queries, schema, data integrity.
- Build tooling: Check config, dependencies, environment.

### Step 3: Reduce

Create the minimal failing case:

- Remove unrelated code/config until only the bug remains.
- Simplify the input to the smallest example that triggers the failure.

### Step 4: Fix the Root Cause

Fix the underlying issue, not the symptom. Avoid patching only the path named in the ticket if it leaves sibling callers broken. Fix the root cause once, at the source.
